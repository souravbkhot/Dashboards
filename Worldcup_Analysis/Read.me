Cricket World Cup Analysis Using Power-BI



• Development of an insightful Cricket Performance Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging DAX functions and integrating data from three CSV files: bowler.csv, batsman.csv, and ODI match 
results.csv. The dashboard provided comprehensive performance metrics for batsmen and bowlers, enabling data-driven decision-making in the cricket team.
• Employed Power BI card visuals to neatly display the aggregated information, such as the total runs scored by the batsmen and the total wickets taken by the bowlers.
• Implemented a slicer to allow users to filter the dashboard for past match results, and show their visualization through Donut Graph.
